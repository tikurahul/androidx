     *         type
     *     <li>Changing the cardinality of a data type to be less restrictive (e.g. changing an
     *         {@link AppSearchSchema.PropertyConfig#CARDINALITY_OPTIONAL OPTIONAL} property into a
     *         {@link AppSearchSchema.PropertyConfig#CARDINALITY_REPEATED REPEATED} property.

     * <ul>
     *     <li>Removal of an existing type
     *     <li>Removal of a property from a type
     *     <li>Changing the data type ({@code boolean}, {@code long}, etc.) of an existing property
     *     <li>For properties of {@code Document} type, changing the schema type of
     *         {@code Document}s of that property
     *     <li>Changing the cardinality of a data type to be more restrictive (e.g. changing an
     *         {@link AppSearchSchema.PropertyConfig#CARDINALITY_OPTIONAL OPTIONAL} property into a
     *         {@link AppSearchSchema.PropertyConfig#CARDINALITY_REQUIRED REQUIRED} property).
